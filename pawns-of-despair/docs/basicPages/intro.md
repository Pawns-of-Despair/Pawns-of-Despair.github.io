Pawns of Despair is a top-down 2D turn-based game, similar to XCOM, with roguelike elements. The game allows for many different themes, all consolidated into a turn-based tactical battle framework.

You are a commander of a mercenary team. You take on contracts to make that sweet money, all while completing contracts. Your team of Pawns are a group of highly trained individuals that have the power to do anything. It is up to you to utilize the best out of them and make them the best they possibly can be. The world has advanced dramatically, allowing traveling to other planets and fighting against abominations that do not exist in the current world. 

The mercenary special forces regiment is split into different groups, which some groups take on different contracts and solve different problems in the world. This can lead to some groups fighting each other due to the conflicting contracts. You take on the lead of one of these groups (up to 6 selected Pawns). Your goal is to complete the contracts handed to you, despite possibly being pitted against your fellow allies.

The general aesthetic should be grittier and focus more on Pawns, past, present, and future as special forces and mercenaries. Aesthetics takes a backseat, the main goal is gameplay first.
