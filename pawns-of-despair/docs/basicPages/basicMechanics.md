The player picks 6 characters (Pawns) to fight with. A number (depending on the mode) of enemies are fought (either spawned by the computer or human players). The AI enemies will have their preset abilities and move sets, or use a similar set of 6 characters.

The game goes as follows: your turn, their turn, your turn, their turn (assuming 1v1 vs computer). Against human players, the turn order may change (details in game modes). Each character has action points that will allow the player characters to do some actions. You can end turn whenever, or if you run out of action points.

To balance against the first team moving in an advantage, the second and later teams gets scaling Brace, Focus, and Haste (damage reduction, higher starting MP, and higher starting AP) to make up for the lost turn. Each later turn would be an extra 10% Brace and 1 AP Haste.

### **Each character will have access to the following actions:**

Move - Move 1 tile per movement point.

Basic Attack - Attack an enemy, costs X action points (depends on character).

Overwatch - End the character’s moves, attack any enemy that enters a certain radius of tiles. Must have at least the amount of action points for a basic attack to use.

Brace - End the character’s actions, if the character did not attack, block 25% damage incoming.

Resurrect - If a character runs out of HP, instead of dying, they are downed and can be resurrected by other characters, taking 5 action points in 1 range, or with a healing ability. If they are attacked while downed, they will respawn in the next fight in roguelike mode, but if all characters are killed, you lose.

Unless stated, all statuses and buffs last for 1 turn.

### **Content to unlock:**

Every character (Pawn) is unlocked immediately, and skill tree progression is done per game. Goal is not to gate players on content, but open the floor for team composition and thinking outside the box. There may be cosmetics to unlock over time or over specific curated content, or achievements.

<br>

### **Monetization:**

I am considering skins through a currency system (that can be unlocked by grinding, paying, or ad watching), and donation through Patreon system. No paid game or paid unlockable gameplay content. I am interested in exploring a roguelike + currency/ad system. Not sure how to implement that.
