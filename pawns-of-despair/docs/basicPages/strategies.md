This page covers some strategies that I can think of off the top of my head.

The list includes:

- Rush
- Carry
- Combo
- Turtle
- AP Economy

Details:

There's a standard frontline/backline/support style that you can do, which generally focuses on consistent aggressive damage, doing enough damage to constantly keep forcing forward and taking stronger positions.

There's a less standard "carry" style that requires more frontline and support to buff up the backline to "carry" your damage and essentially be some unkillable powerhouse.

There's a combo oriented style that requires doing some specific playstyle/strategy and forcing a combo, burst damage after a small interval, which requires setup and specific way to play. For example, focusing on a burst strategy to maximize damage by forcing enemies to be in the chess pieces, or isolating and kidnapping strategy, where you try to kidnap someone and burst them by isolating them.

There's a turtle strategy to focus on tile positioning and advantageous positions, defensive style. This style of play utilizes tile bonuses, cover, terrain, and overwatch significantly to force the enemy into a poor positioning.

There's a strategy to try to force AP advantages, in order to outsustain the enemy and force them to not be able to do very much. This allows you to play lower damage, and slowly whittle the enemy down since they have no AP.
