Target Platform is PC, then Mobile (Android secondarily, iOS if somehow I can figure out the $100/year developer price). Use Photon for multiplayer and test inhouse only for a while. Basic plan for first build is to build a simple turn based fight with 6 characters of choice to work with.

Update 2024: we can use 100 CCU to test now. Possibly Firebase for inner details of player data.

Over time, build more features. Prioritize content (enemies, test subjects), randomization/replayability, gameplay. Nice to have: Cooler abilities, skill trees, deeper fight design, optimization for mobile/multiplayer.

This is a spreadsheet for testing as well, which could be good for collaborative playtesting.

Currently, our website does the best job for documentation.

For document writing, previously we used Notion, and we can export this as a pdf, convert to doc, and upload to google docs in case Notion has issues.
